Goal is to make a new beat or creation every day. Eventually, i think we'll have developed some cool skills and hopefully good music.


For the first little while, I'll probably just try to clone music in an attempt to learn the tools. 

Day 1: COLORS by AVAILON. Great beat, my version is pretty much as good as the real thing
